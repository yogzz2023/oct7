now that i have measurements ( take as range ,azimuth,elevation ) and its respective Sf of each track id 

i want to plot the values in range and Sf(range) vs time ,Sf(azimuth) and azimuth vs time ,Sf(elevation) and elevation vs time 

also add data tip on clicking the point i get the attributes like (track id (range,az,elevation and time))

give me the updated code after doing the changes to my existing code
